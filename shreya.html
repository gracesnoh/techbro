		<p>To the one and only TechBro:<br>
		(I hope you know that this particular nickname is going to stick, whether you like it or not!)<br><br>
		I can't believe that we're already ending this semester, because getting that phone call from you welcoming me into Blueprint last dead week doesn't seem too long ago. Did I mention I'm glad you didn't try and prank call us? I don't think I would have quite understood how much of a troll you really can be. I like to think that everyone on External is their own interesting character, and that definitely applies to you.<br><br>
		Even though you run far too early in the morning and are a bit too cold to Sameera, your brand of sarcasm is super refreshing and probably the only thing that could have balanced out how odd us chairs are. Also, I think it goes without saying that you have such a big heart - each time we thought of an idea or asked a question about Blueprint, you always replied back with the greatest concern and thoughtfulness towards doing better and making an impact. You probably think that those things should be expected, not praiseworthy, but I think that they really are exceptions among people.<br><br>
		Anyways, I'm beyond grateful that you took it upon yourself to make External as great as possible. From taking time of your days to teach us code to making us bond through dinner meetings as opposed to getting out as quickly as possible, you put in so much thought and work into everything, and even though not everything was perfect, I do think you did an amazing job. I absolutely can't wait to see how much of an impact you're going to make in the next few semesters; it's not often that someone with such bold ideas is prepared and motivated to see them through, and I only hope that I can help if you ever need it!<br><br>
		Here's to future meals, hang-outs, spontaneous meet-ups in South Bay with your twin, and other stuff - even if you're sick of us three, I'm sorry that we will continue to bother you. After all, you are our one and only TechBro.</p>
