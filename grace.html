		<p>Hi TechBro! (AKA Vivek)<br>I can't believe how fast this semester has gone by... it feels like only yesterday when I got that phone call from you and you told me I was going to be a part of Blueprint. From the very beginning, you were such a capable leader and very easy to get along with. Thanks for making my transition into Blueprint so much easier and funner than I thought it would be. I'm so proud of all of the work we've done as a team together and grateful for your constant reminders and efforts to keep us involved with the rest of Blueprint. I have to admit that even though your sarcastic comments are mean, they make me laugh!

		Although there may be a chance that I won't be a part of External in the future, I will always root for the team and support you guys in any way I can. </p>
