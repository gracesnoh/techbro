		<p>Hi TechBro! (AKA Vivek)
		<br><br>
		I can't believe how fast this semester has gone by... it feels like only yesterday when I got that phone call from you and you told me I was going to be a part of Blueprint. From the very beginning, you were such a capable leader and very easy to get along with. Thanks for making my transition into Blueprint so much easier and funner than I thought it would be. I'm so proud of all of the work we've done as a team together and grateful for your constant reminders and efforts to keep us involved with the rest of Blueprint. I have to admit that even though your sarcastic comments are mean, they make me laugh! Thank you for your coding lessons and all the times I bothered you for help with coding stuff. I learned and got so much from your teaching (I even was able to make this website because of you!).
		<br><br>
		Although I won't be a part of External in next semester, I will always root for the team and support you guys in any way I can. Don't worry, I'm definitely not gone for good; I might just stalk what you guys are up to on Slack #external haha! Thanks again for everything Vivek, I really had a great time this semester working with you and the rest of External.</p>
