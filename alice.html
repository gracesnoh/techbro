		<p>Dear Vivek,<br>

		I can say without hesitation that you are one of the few people I admire and am inspired by here at Cal. Thank you so much for being such a great leader during my first full semester in Blueprint. It has been transformative due to your efforts in guidance, answering my questions, and always taking the extra step to make sure I felt comfortable and welcome. It really meant a lot and has shaped how I interact with others as well. I'm excited to see what we achieve together next semester-- get ready to be hazed! Thank you, thank you, and thank you!</p>
